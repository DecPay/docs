### Exchange rate conversion

### Way 1, using third party API exchange rate interface

[Coingecko API Service](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)  
[Coinmarketcap API service](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)  

> Basically, third-party API services are all fee-based, if you do not consider the cost of API fees can use these APIs, more stable

### Way 2, use Chainlink's feed data (recommended)

+ You can use the feed data for free
+ More decentralized pricing
  
Read chainlink's feeds directly to get remittance rates.
